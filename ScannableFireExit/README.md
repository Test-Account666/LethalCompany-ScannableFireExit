# Scannable Fire Exits Mod

"The company found some extra money in the recently fired executive's desk and decided to add Scan Nodes to Fire
Exits"<br>

This mod allows Fire Exits to be scanned like the main entrance.

If you want a little more challenge, you can configure this mod to only allow the scanning of Fire Exits you visited.
